# Surogou
Surogou is a ficticious audio company whose goal is to teach audio DSP techniques and theory to students who want to learn about audio plugin development, audio synthesis design, and other audio topics. This landing page showcases Surogou's new book about audio DSP titled "Develop Audio Plugins" that teaches the fundamental audio principles to learn digital audio, MIDI, audio synthesis, and audio signal flow.

This was my first project using Bootstrap and my main goal was to create a great looking landing page for a ficticious company, that looks like a real company, which showcases my ability to create professional looking websites.
